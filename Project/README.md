# Title

# Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?

# Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project. 

* Which are the type vehicles with more accident risk in Geneva?
* Which are the main causes of accidents?
* Can we identify clusters by type of accidents?
* Does the weather influences on the risk to have an accident?
* Does the time of a day influences on the risk to have an accident?
* Does the day of the week influences on the risk to have an accident?
* Where are the regions or routes with more accidents in Geneva?
* Does the state of the route is correlated with the risk to have an accident?



# Dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.

From _Swiss open data_ site, the datasets selected are the following:
* ACCIDENTS DE LA CIRCULATION (DEPUIS 2010):
* COMPTAGE DU TRAFIC ROUTIER: 

From 

The accidents dataset has geolocalisation on it. The way to enrich this dataset is to cross information with trafic density data, important points in the city, corossing points, etc.





# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
Add here a sketch of your planning for the next project milestone.

Planning:

1. Understand the data (from 1st Nov. to 8 Nov.) 
    1.1. Missing values
    1.2. Change the data formats
    1.3. Understand the categorical data
    1.4. Find distributions 
    1.5. Correlations between the different features
    
2. Enrich the dataset(from 9 Nov. to )
    2.1. Find diferent dataset with interesting information
    2.2. Understand the new data
    2.3. Transform this data
    2.4. Merge with th global dataset
    
3. Brainstorm about ideas of how to visualise the results:
    3.1. Libraries
    3.2. Specific plots(Heat maps, timelapse, etc)
